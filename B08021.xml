            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.
      </p>

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Therfore I as one of the leſt learned of all, as it hath pleaſed god to giue me his grace herein, haue ſet forth rudely (more regardynge to open the ſyncere doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne of the holy gooſt, to goddes glory and to the edifyinge of other then I haue ſtuded for eloquence in wordes) an expoſition in the Epiſtle of ſanyt Paule to the Philippia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s openynge this parte of holy ſcripture as I truſt accordyng to the mynde of the holy gooſt by whom it was wryten, exhortynge all men to reade the holy ſcriptures and expoſitions of them with all reuerence to god and to his worde in meakenes of ſpirite deſyrous to know god, loue him and feare him and to know their dewty to god and to there nygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure and to vſe their knowlege with all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryete and to flee vyce and take vertu, yf not for loue of god yet for feare of puniſhment of god for vyce and ſynne, for the ende of ſynne is death Ro. 6. And ſo I truſt I haue opened this Epiſtle accordynge both to the mynde of the holy gooſt the author of holy ſcriptures, and alſo to the trewe vſe of holy ſcriptures with al ſobriete not paſſynge the boundes of ſcripture. And to do this thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g I haue vſed the

helpe both the tonges and alſo of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyky authors that beſt declareth the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures and moſt for the glory of god and the edifiyng of the vnlearned in the latine tonge, as ſhall appere more planly to all them, that wyll reade with a good mynde deſyrous to know god and loue god this rude expoſition partly ſet forth for the diſcharge of my conſci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence and ſmall talent gyuen me of god not to be ydle, but to exerciſe it to goddes glory and to the edifycatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of other, and partly to excite better learned men then I am to ſet forth in prynte ſome commentares or expoſitions in latine or in englyſhe, that goddes word might the better be knowne and god more gloryfied of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vyce deſtroyed and vertu and godly lyuyng brought in the ſtede of vyce vſed and euyll lyuynge. And ſo I wolde wyſhe that hye Ruelers and byſſhoppes wolde ſet lerned men on worke, and cauſe them to ſet forth ſome godly expoſitions vpon the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that the vnlearned people ſhulde not erre nor take amyſſe the holy ſcriptures, or otherwyſe gather ony ſence of them, then the holy gooſt wylleth. And for that cauſe and other I haue here in this lytell epiſtle ſhewed my mynde after the talent gyuen me of god. yf this my rude labors &amp; paynes do agre with holy ſcriptures as I thynke they do agre, I beſeche the gentle Reader accepte them in goodworth, and gyue laude and prayſe to god the author of all goodnes and not to the wryter of this expoſition whoſe mynd is and euer haue bene to profyt all men and to hurte

no man. And yf this my rude labors ſhalbe-thought profytable to the chriſtiane congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Englande as I iudge it ſhalbe cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, god wyllynge I intende to ſet forth lyke thynges in other places of holy ſcripture in englyſhe or in latine, yf it ſhalbe thought good or elles I wyll abſteyne from wrytynge. But yf any thyng by ignorance or otherwyſe hath eſcaped me in this rude expoſition that I haue here wryten other wyſe then goddes worde teacheth refuſe it gentyll Reader, and knowe that I am a man and maye erre and that to one man be not all knowlege gyuen leſſe he ſhulde be to proude in him ſelfe and contemne al other. Therfore as holy wryters of ſcriptures ſaith of their doctrine ſo I ſay of my ſainges or wrytinges, that I wold they ſhulde be iudged trwly by the holy ſcriptures and no furder to be beleued then they maye be prouede and confyrmed by holy ſcriptures as knoweth god to whome be all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory euer AMEN.</p>

Here we may ſe that in Paules lyfe there was ſome good preachers, ſome euyll preachers, nor euery one dyd not thynke well of Paule, for ſome thought him an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyke and a deceyuer of the people, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they labored with all diligence to increa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe his paynes, and ſtuded to brynge Paule to ſhame rebuke turmentes and death, other there was that knewe Paule to preache the truth and to defende the goſpell by his afflyctions, and they made bolde by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and pacience to preache and publyſhe Chrſtes goſpell without all feare, and that in the courte and hall of Nero.

So here we maye learne that Chriſte maye be ſhewed of euyll men, whiche profyt not them ſelfes ſo doyng, but other, ſo euyll men ſome tymes do workes profytable to other, but not to them ſelfes. yf it had not ben a good worke and pleaſante to god Chriſt to be openly preached of euyll men Paule wolde not haue reioyſed in it, wherfore we may ſe; that it is better an euyll man to gyue a peny to a poore man, and to ſpeake well of god then to gyue nothynge at all, or to ſpeake nothynge of god that is good, this worke done of an euyll man is not merytorius as they call it, for it is not done in fayth, but it is called bonum opus in gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re, a good worke in it ſelfe, yf it were done of a good faythfull ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and of a good intent, it ſhulde haue his rewarde but bycauſe it com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth from an euyll man and of no good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it lacketh his rewarde before god, for god doth not eſteme workes done out of fayth &amp; of an euyl ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuch workes be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable

            <p>Before he hath ſhewed the euyll purpoſes of them that preached Chriſte of contention and of a prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſed holynes and not of a good mynde or wyll, but to hynder the goſpel (whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che they promoted ſo doynge) although they inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the contrary, and alſo to haue added to Paule more greuous paynes and afflicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now he declareth that his aduerſares

culde not hurte him, nor brynge him to death, but rather the contrary he truſted throughe their humylle prayer and adminyſtration of the ſpirite of god gyuen to him, whiche can and wyll make all the labors of the aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res vayne, and make them to ſerue goddes truth, and to be profytable to goddes myniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters rather then hurte to them. Nowe howe Paule ſurely truſted the euyll purpoſes of his aduerſares to be profytable to him and to the goſpell of god by two thynges, the one is by their prayer for he knewe the prayer of a iuſte man to be moche worth before god. Iame. 5. And therfore he vſed moche prayer, and deſired oftymes the prayers of other to teache vs to do ſuche lyke. Secondly he hoped the euyll doynges of his aduerſares not to hurte but rather to forder the goſpell by the admynyſtration of the holy ghoſt, to whom nothyng is impoſſible or dyfficulte, but he wyll do what thyng that ſhall be moſt to god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des glory, to the forderaunce of his worde, and the health of the people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As I loke for and hope that in nothynge I ſhall be aſhamed.) The apoſtle ſheweth that his hope ſhuld neuer deceyue him, for he was ſure that theſe that put their ful truſt &amp; hoope in god ſhulde not be confunded, ſhulde neuer haue cauſe to myſtruſt god, ſhuld at the lenght opteyne that thynge they hopeth for of god, as it is wrytten oftymes in Dauids pſalter, our fathers haue hoped in the good lorde and they are not confounded, they haue opteyned the thynge they hoped, yea alſo he
<pb facs="tcp:183793:33"/>
ſuerly truſteth, that as god hath ben preſent with him other tymes and in places in his afflictions ſo he truſted that god wolde not leue him now deſtitute his ayde and healpe, but wolde be with him and healpe him, and delyuer him to the preferrement of the goſpel. Here we maye learne of Paule to deſyre o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to praye for vs, and knowe the prayers of other to be profytable, and to haue a ſure truſt in god, and hope, that god wyll not leue his ſeruauntes without helpe and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, although for a tyme he ſuffer them to be in affliccions.</p>
            <p n="3">3, As Chriſt alwayes in tymes paſt, euen ſo now ſhall be magnifyed in my body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be through lyfe or thorugh death.) Here the apoſtle ſhoweth what thynge he hoped of god, that Chriſt ſhuld be alwayes magnified by him, both in lyfe and in death, that yf ſo be it he ſhulde lyue he wolde preache and teache alwhere Chriſtes glorye and make it famous to al the worlde, that al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue all worldly thynges ſhulde deſyre and ſtudy to ſet forthe honour and glory to god, and to our ſauiour Ieſu Chriſte, and to thynke them borne for this ende and purpoſe, and moſte ſpeeyally byſhoppes prelates paſtours and curates whoſe hole ſtudy ſhulde be to promote goddes worde by pure and ſyncere preachynge of it, and ſo by it puerly preached Chriſte ſhulde be magnifyed in their bodyes, that is by them lyuyng in this lyfe in their bodyes ſayeth he, and yf it ſhulde chaunce me to dye as to ſuffer death for the goſpells ſake I do nothynge

dowte, but there by my death Chriſte Ieſus ſhulde be magnifyed, and that he is the onely ſauyour, and that there is no ſaluation with out him, that there is none other in whome we ſhall be ſaued, but onely in Ieſu Chriſte, and yf I ſhall ſuffer death for the goſpelles ſake I ſhulde haue no hurt by that, but moch profyt, whiche thynge I deſyre that I myght be delyuered from moch ſory payne and many euylles in this worlde &amp; to come to the heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ioyes that laſt alwaye, vnto the which I can<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>not come without I be firſte delyuered from this mortall body by bodely death after the example of Chriſt, which firſt did ſuffer death and ſo entred into his glory, ſo muſt they do that ſhalbe partakers of his glorye. Here we learne of Paule that death is more profyta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to good men then lyfe.</p>
            <q>But in as moch as to lyue in the fleſhe is frutful to me for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worke I wote not what I ſhall choſe, for both theſe thynges lye harde vnto me. I deſyre to be louſed, &amp; to be with Chriſt, which thynge were moch better for me, but to a byde in the fleſhe is more nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for you. And this am I ſure of, that I ſhall abyde, and conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new

            <p>The apoſtle openeth now more plainlye, why he ſayde his death ſhulde be to him auau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tage, for by it he ſhulde be delyuered from the myſeries wrechednes paynes tormentes and affliccio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of this worlde, and that he ſhuld be with Chriſt in heauen in glory and ioye, and to lyue in this lyfe he knew it was but payne and labor for him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. what I ſhall choſe I wote not.) Two thynges came to the apoſtles mynde, the one what was good for him only, the other what was more profyt to the people of chriſt Ieſu, as for him ſelfe he knew it was moche better for him to dye then lyue, for by that meanes he ſhulde be delyuered from trobles of the worlde, from impryſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts and chaynes, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rebukes &amp; tauntes of the worlde, but for the people he knewe his lyfe ſhulde be moch more profyt then is death, for he knewe he ſhulde more profyt the people &amp; bryng the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by faythfull preachynge of goddes holy worde, and for the peoples ſake, lokynge to their profyt he dyd not deſyre death, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lyue in his fleſhe, that he myght bryng them to Chriſt and ſo to eternall ſaluation with Chriſt. But of theſe two conſydered all
<pb facs="tcp:183793:34"/>
thynges he choſed rather to dye then to lyue, not that he refuſed labors or to ſuffer paynes of impryſonment or of fetters or of death, for theſe thynges he was contented to ſuffer, but that he myght be delyuered out of the myſeres and wretchednes of this lyfe, and that he myght come to the eternall fylycite and ioye with Chriſte Ieſu in heuen alwayes to be in bliſſe. Here we learne of Paule death rather to be deſyred then lyfe, and deathe of good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be moche better to them, then this preſente lyfe, that they ſhulde be no longer pylgrymars or far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god, but alwayes to be preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in glory &amp; filycite. And therfore holy me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red of god to be diſſolued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this body &amp; this noughty world full of noughtynes &amp; vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pynes, that they ſhulde diſpleſe god no more, that they ſhuld be wrapped no le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the euyls &amp; myſeres of this world ful of al euylnes, that they myghte be with god in ioye &amp; in heuenly glory, ſo after the example of good men ſhulde we al deſyre rather death the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lyfe as they dyd. The apoſtle here reproueth them that feare death, and ſhrynketh in theyr bodyes when they here of death, as doth carnall and worldly men, whoſe harte &amp; mynde is all vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> carnall pleaſures &amp; worldly deſyres honours and dignytes, for the fleſhe feareth death and ſhrynketh at the voyce of death, as Chriſte dyd after his humane nature, but he ouer came death, that we ſhulde nothynge feare death of the body, which we know ſhall aryſe agayne an immortalle body. 1.

Alſo the lyfe of man is aſſembled to graſſe. Eſay. 40. To a ſhadowe or to a cloude. Sap. 2 whiche ſhortly paſſeth away. And. Iob. 14. ſaith, that a man borne of a woman lyueth a lytyll tyme, &amp; is fylled with all miſeres, and goeth away as a floure, and is trode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe, and fleeth as aſhadow, and neuer taryeth in one ſtate. Therefore let vs not make moch of our panted ſheth, that is of our freale and corruptyble bodye, a lumpe of hearth whiche is as a tente to tary in for a lytell tyme as Peter ſayth. 2. Peter. 1. Let vs thynke that yf the houſe of this tabernacle ſhuld be deſtroyed we haue a buyldynge with god, a byldynge euerlaſtynge in heauen not made by mannes hande. 2. Cor. 5. Therfore let vs watche that death ſtele not vpon vs ſlepynge, and come vpon vs vnwares and vnprouyded, leſſe we be excluded out from heauen and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heuenly ioyes, let vs take good heed that the dore be not ſhytte to vs, and we not ſuffered to come
<pb facs="tcp:183793:36"/>
in, let vs prouyde for death, that when god ſhall come and call vs by corporall death we be not then founde ſloo and vnprofytable ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uaunces, not lokynge for the commyng of the lorde, leſte he be angry with vs, and deuyde vs, and put our partes with hypochrytes, where as ſhalbe wepynge and gnaſſhynge of teath, let vs be readye altymes for death and then we ſhall not feare death, let vs haue a trewe fayth in Chriſte, puere charyte to our nighbors, and lyue vertuouſly, and then death ſhalbe wellcome to vs at all tymes.</p>
            <p>¶ There is thre thynges that maketh death terryble and fearfull to men, but they are not to be feared.</p>
            <p>The fyrſte is an euyll opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of late dayes creped in and ryſen by the anabaptiſtes, or by other ignorant in goddes holy worde. Some there be that thinketh the ſoules of good faythfull men departed this preſent lyfe do not go to reſt, peace &amp; glory with Chriſte, but that they ſlepe with out perceyuynge good or euyll, and that they lacke the ioye of heuen tyll the daye of iudgemente, &amp; this euyll opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon maketh ſome to feare corporal deth but let this euil opynyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feare no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to dye &amp; to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>part his preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t lyfe, for they that dye i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt be blyſſed and in peace reſte comforte and with Chriſte and ſo in ioye and blyſſe, as I ſhall ſhewe more at large by the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of god. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de thyng that maketh men to feare death is the olde inueterated opynyon of the thyrde place ſomtyme called purgatory in to the which place all the ſoules as they haue ſayde goeth of them whiche is
<pb facs="tcp:183793:36"/>
in this worlde hathe not fully ſatyſfyed for their ſynnes by workes here in this preſente lyfe done, and in that thirde place greuouſly punyſhed with great paynes and intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble punyſhmentes, which nothynge dyffer fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the paynes of hell as they ſaye, but that the paynes of purgatory called haue an ende, the paynes of hell haue no ende, but alwayes ſhall endure and be more greuous and gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to ſuche as ſhall ſuffer in hell and the paynes therof, but yf we lyue well and dye in Chriſt we ſhall not nede to feare the paynes of this thirde place after this lyfe, for holy ſcripture put good men in more comfort, then ſo, as a none by goddes grace ye ſhall redde here by holy ſcriptures. The third thing that maketh men to abhore death is the paynes of hell thretened of god to euyll lyuers for their ſynnes to be iuſtly puniſhed, whiche paynes men ſhulde feare in dede, and leue lyuynge euill and liue wel after goddes lawes as they haue profeſſed to lyue. Men perſueryng whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhulde dye and chaunge this corporall lyfe, and that they muſt go ether to heauen, purgatory, or to hell, and that noue goeth ſtrayght to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without he haue ful ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for his ſynnes here, as fewe or none do, &amp; yf any do, yet the euyll opynyon ſayth that they ſhall not go to heauen tyll the daye of the laſt iudgement, but to that tyme be with out ioye and blyſſe, and yf they ſhall go to the thirde place, or to hell, they be in extreme paynes and tormentes, men theſe thynges conſyderynge it is no meruell thoughe they
<pb facs="tcp:183793:37"/>
feare death, howe can they not feare death that thynketh their lyfe after this preſente lyfe not to be better but moch worſe, in paines and great puniſhmentes. But theſe thre bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhulde not make vs to feare to dye in Chriſt. For the fyrſte opinion is an euyll opy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyon and contrary to the holy ſcriptures whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che ſaith that the ſoules of good men be with Chriſt, and yf they be with Chriſt they lacke no ioye ne comforte glory or felicite. Saynte Paule ſayth here I deſyre to be diſſolued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this mortall body and to be with Chriſt, he thought to be with Chriſte, yf he were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued from this corruptible body, and lyke it is ſpoken. 2. Cor. 5. As longe as we be in this body, we be farre from god, therfore we wolde be farre from this body and to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with god, ſuche as be preſent with god be in ioye and felicite. And. Math. 26. Chriſte ſayde to the thefe crucifyed with him vpon the croſſe, this daye, not to morowe or at the laſt iudgement thou ſhal be with me in para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. Sapience. 3. Confyrmeth this thynge ſayng. If the iuſte man be preuented by death he ſhalbe in refreſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and agayne the ſame ſayth that the ſoules of good men be in the handes of god, and no tormentes of malice touche them, they appere to the eyes of the wicked to dye, but they be i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peace Alſo. Lu. 16 ſheweth playnly that Lazarus was in ioye and comforte and the ryche man in paynes and tormentes. Theſe places of holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and many mo that myght be brought for the ſame purpoſe doth ſufficiently proue
<pb facs="tcp:183793:37"/>
that the ſoules of good men departed this lyfe are with god and with Chriſte in ioye blyſſe peace refreſſhynge comforte and in reſt without all payne of malyce as the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tures afore alleged doth ſufficienly proue. As touchyng the ſecode thynge that bryngeth men in feare to dye I thynke we nede not to feare that bugge, for that place is vncertaine to vs and the name of it, the ſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſoules departed (as the kynges booke ſayth ſpekyng of the thirde place called ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme purgatory) yf they be not with god or in hell. The holy ſcriptures doth appere to make no mention of it, and then be the ſame autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryte it is affirmed by the ſame it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed as ſayth Ierome. Mat. 23. And yf it be ſuche a thynge as byſhoppes of Rome maye robbe and ſpoyle at their pleaſure, and wyll not, yf there be any ſuche paynes as they haue ſayd or feyned to be, then they be very vncharytable and vnmarcyfull, charyte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to do to thy neyghbour as thou wold be done to, Marcy perſuadeth delyueraunce from paynes and tormentes, and yf money which bought popes pardones indulgence in pylgrymages and in maſſes ſayde ad ſcala celi myght ryd men out of the great paynes of that place, then it appereth that ryche me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was alwaye happy, for they be their monye byenge perdons was ſone delyueryd out of paynes, and poore men euer vohappy, that had not money to bye pardons, for they muſt lye ſtyll in tormentes, but how that doth agre with Chriſtes ſaynge. Luke. 6. I can not
<pb facs="tcp:183793:38"/>
tell he ſayth. woo be to you ryche that laught for you ſhall wepe, not all ryche men ſhall wepe, but ſuche as abuſe their ryches, but of this third place I wyl not ſpeke, but this the ſcriptures doth ſaye that he that dyeth in the fayth of Ieſus Chriſt he reſteth in peace with Chriſte, &amp; yf he dye out of faithe he is iudged, he that beleuyth hath lyfe, and he that do not beleue is now iudged. Iohn. 3. He ſpeaketh of a trew and lyuely faith workynge by charite at all oportunite and occaſion gyuen, and af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter his habilite. And as for the thirde bugge that bryngeth men in feare of death that is the thynge that ſhulde feare men and plucke them from ſynne and ſynfull lyuynge, leſſe they come to the paynes of hell and there be in tormentes euer more without ende, to the which paynes they ſhall come that here lyue wyckedly contrary to the wyll and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of god, yf they before death do not repente and amend and call to god for grace and mercy and opteyne pardon and remyſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſynnes and walke in a new lyfe hauynge ſure fayth in Chriſt hope and charite, conty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and increaſe in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Here we may learne of Paule rather to deſyre death then lyfe, and death is rather to be deſyred of trewe chriſtians then to be dred, and that for many cauſes, &amp; moch ꝓfyt to vs Fyrſt where is a trew fayth it maketh them certayne of eternall lyfe as ſayth ſai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Iohn. 3 He that beleueth hath eternall lyfe vnto the which we can not come without the death of the body, therfore death is to be wyſſhed of
<pb facs="tcp:183793:38"/>
vs that we maye come to lyfe.</p>
            <p>Seconde. If we beleue god to be our father, and yf we loue him aboue all creatures in this worlde we wyll deſyre aboue all thynges to come vnto our father ſo louynge ſo kynde ſo meryfull full al goodnes ryches and glory, to our father we can not come excepte before by death we be ſeperated from our mortall bodyes, therfore let vs deſyre death that we maye come to our heauenly father whome we loue aboue all thynges.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. As longe as we are in this mortall bodye we be farre from god. 2. Cor. 5: To be preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with god we alway deſyre, to be preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with god we can not, without we be ded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this corporall body, death therfore is not to be feared, but deſired, that we maye be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente in glory with god.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. Pylgrames and ſtrangers farre from home deſyreth euer homewardes, and is not mery nor quiet tyll they come home where their treaſure ryches frendes landes and poſſeſſyons be, we chriſtians as longe as we be in this lyfe we be as ſtrangers and geaſtes farre from home wandrynge with moche care and heuy hartes, hauynge heare no dwellynge place. Hebre. 12. But ſekynge the habitation to come whiche is in heauen, where is our home our ryches our treaſure layd vp, ſurely keped for vs, &amp; our landes and poſſeſſions, yea a kyngdome an empyre, our frendes and kynſfolkes, &amp; thether we can not come excepte before by deeath we forſake this corruptyble body, death therfore is of vs all
<pb facs="tcp:183793:39"/>
greatly to be deſyred and not to be dred, for by it we enter to take poſſeſſion of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly inheritage ioye and blyſſe.</p>
            <p>Fiftely. As longe as we are in this noughty body we are ſubiected to many euylles and moch myſery, many ſicknes &amp; diſeaſes as to feuers agues palſey dropſye gout pockes peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylence and to many other ſorowes paynes and trobles from the whiche all death dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth vs, and without death we can not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delyuered from them, therfore death is to be wyſſhed that we maye be delyuered from all myſerys and wretchednes of this preſen lyfe. Syxtly. No hurte or dammage we ſuffer by the death of the body but get moche profyt and commodite, by death we be delyuered fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mortalyte and made immortall, we are ryd from paynes and brought to ioye, receyue life and heauenly ſaluation, and then we ſhalbe lyke to god in glory in eternall felycite and in heauenly inheritaunce, to the which Chriſt hath called vs and redemyd vs with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceous bloode, and in heauen we ſhalbe in ſuch ioye &amp; glory as no tonge can tel nor eye hath euer ſeen, nor heare harde, nor mans hart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> can not compaſſe that glorye and ioye that god hath prepared for them that loue him 1. Cor. 2. But to theſe ioyes and felycytes we can not attayne vnto, excepte we firſte dye and be delyuered from our mortall bodyes, theſe thynges yf we wyll conſyder them well and deaply in our hartes wey them, there is no cauſe why we ſhulde feare death of the body, but rather we ſhulde deſyre it as Paule
<pb facs="tcp:183793:39"/>
and other holy men dyd deſyrynge to be out of this corruptible and noughty body and to be preſent with god.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I deſyre to be lowſed, and to be wtih Chriſte.) Paule deſyred to be dyſſolued from his mortall body that he myghte be with Chriſt, ſo ſhulde we do, and not to feare death but deſyre death, yf it were ſo the wyll of god, for death is not to be feared to good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but rather to be deſyred, for the death of good men ſayth the prophete is precious in the ſyght of the lord. And therfore many good men hath deſyred death and to be delyuered from this body lode with ſynne, that they myght be with god and with Chriſte Ieſu in glory.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But to abyde in the fleſſhe is more nede full for you.) Paule ſheweth here although it were better for him ſelfe to dye then lyue, yet he ſayth that it ſhulde be more profyt for theſe Philippians that he ſhulde lyue then dye, and that they ſhulde haue more profyt by his lyfe then by his death, by the which ſayng he doth appere to ſaye that ſayntes can not profyt men ſo moche beynge ded as yf they were lyuing, and ſo there prayers not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyt men here lyuing ſo moch as dyd their pure preachynge of the goſpell when they lyued vpon hearth, and in their corporall bodyes. 5. And this am I ſure of that I ſhall abyde and contynewe with you all, for the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce, and ioye of your fayth, that ye maye abundantly reioyſe in Chriſte Ieſu, through my commynge to you agayne.) Not howe
<pb facs="tcp:183793:40"/>
ſure Paule was that he ſhulde retourne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to thes Philippians and abyde and contynew amonges them, and that to their profytes bothe to the increaſemente of their fayth, and alſo to their greatter reioyſe in god by his commyng to them, here we learne that god ſhewethe ſometyme to ſome theſe thinges that do folow, as here paule ſheweth his delyueraunce and commynge to theſe Philippians and the profyt of his commyng. Alſo this place wylleth that the commynge of the byſhop or paſtor to his cure ſhulde not be without ſpirituall profyt for his flocke that it ſhulde be to the increaſment of fayth by pure and ſyncere preachynge of goddes worde and that they ſhulde more and more reioyſe in god, knowynge goddes benefites the better by the worde of god purely preached by the byſhoppe paſtor or curate. And this place doth ſomethyng reproue theſe byſſhoppes that be du<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me and wyl not preache when they come into their dioceſe, that wyll not feade their people with the foode of the ſoule, but ſuffer them to peryſſe without foode for them, how ſhulde byſhoppes increaſe the trew faith of the people that wyll not preache to the people goddes worde, for as fayth commeth by hearynge of goddes worde, ſo it is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſame worde. And as Paule more regarded theſe thynges that ſhulde be profy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to other then to him ſelfe, ſo ſhulde all other do both byſhoppes paſtores curates and all the laye people, but alas for petye few or none ſeketh others profyt but their owne,
<pb facs="tcp:183793:40"/>
and ſo they be well &amp; lyue in eaſe reſt &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they care not what become of other, what paynes or tormentes other ſuffer, but let euery one amende this faute, and ſtudy to be profytable as well to other as to him ſelfe, for we be not borne for our ſelfes alone, but to gloryfye god and to profyt other by wordes conſell workes and dedes as god hath gyuen his gyftes and talentes, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not all gyftes be gyuen to one, but to dyuers, that euery one ſhulde be an helper to an other, and euery one nedes healpe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

And heare the apoſtle declareth that he was not carefull for him ſelfe, nor ſought his owne profyt or delyuerance out of priſon and bondes, but rather was carefull for other, ſought the profyt of other more then his owne profyt. Here we learne that a clere conſcience and a iuſte cauſe diliuereth him that is in pryſon from carefulnes for him ſelfe, maketh him glade rather then ſory or heauy, it maketh his payne or affliction to be to him as no payne at all, but that ſuche be careful for other and deſireth that other may lyue a life mete for a chriſtiane, and lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the euylnes and malyce of euyll men, and prayth god for the euyll that he wyll conuert them

as for his owne profyt, for when euery man ſtudyeth, inordynatly deſyreth his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyt and careth not what hurte or dammage come to other ſo he be well him ſelfe, there muſte nedes ryſe diſcorde and debate and many inconueniences, whiche chaunce not where as euery man ſtudeth the profyt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and preferreth other before him ſelfe I wolde they ſhulde rede and marke diligenlye what the holy gooſt requireth, they that be proude and vayne gloryous more diligent ſekers of theyr owne profyt, then of others, yea who doth this place not rebuke &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne, and let vs all pull a waye al vayne glory, and let vs ſtudy not only to profyt our ſelfes but other, &amp; be not ſuche as care for none but for our ſelfes and our owne belyes and bely chere, this place reproueth vs al for to moche loue of our ſelfes and to lytle of other, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ꝓueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that care not what chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce come to other ſo they be well them ſelfes, ſo they lyue in welth and pleaſure hauynge all thyng at wyll and pleaſure and commaundement, let all ſuche remember in the myddes of their pleaſures, that from theſe carnall pleaſures they ſhall go, and that to paynes, yf their ple<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>aſures haue ben with the diſpleaſures hurte and iniurye of other, contrary to goddes will and pleaſure.</p>
            <q>Lette the ſame mynde be in you that was in Chriſt Ieſu, whiche being in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhape of god, thought
<pb facs="tcp:183793:46"/>
it no robbery to be equall with god, but made him ſelfe of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and toke vpon him the ſhape of a ſeruante, bycam elyke another man, and was founde in his apparell as a man, he humbled him ſelfe, and was obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient vnto death, euen the death of the croſſe.</q>
            <p>The apoſtle here exhorteth vs to humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and to ſeke the profyt of othe after the example of Chriſte Ieſu, whiche ſo humbled him ſelfe althought he was equall with god the father in deite ſubſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and dyuyne power, that he was becommed as aſeruaunt and deiected him ſelfe vnder other as though he had ben the moſte vyleſt ſeruaunte, when he was lorde of all lordes, and kynge aboue all kynges of this worlde, this thynge dyd Chriſte to teache vs humylite and to humble our ſelfes, Chriſte beynge in the ſhape of god equall to god in deite and dyuyne power eſſence and ſubſtaunce thought it no robbery him to be equall with god, that is by no on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſte tytull he thought he had poſſeſſed that honoure, and no iniury was done to god the father, for Chriſte is god as the father is god and Chriſte and the father be one Iohn. 17. ſaith Chriſt. I and my father are one. And
<pb facs="tcp:183793:47"/>
therfore he knew he ſhulde not loſe that tytul, that he ſhulde be equall with the father in ſubſtaunce and deite, nor feared not the loſynge of it, as theſe do that by robbery or vnlawfully get ony name or tytull of honour or dygnite, Chriſte beynge by nature god thought it no robbery him to be equall with the father. If chriſt dyd humble him ſelfe our lorde and kynge it is a ſhame for vs ſeruaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and ſubiectes to be prowde ſeyng we haue nothyng good but of him, by him &amp; for his ſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke as Iohn teacheth. Iohn. 1. All thynges are by him and without him nothynge is made. This place ſheweth in Chriſte two natures that is to ſaye his dyuyne nature and his humayne nature, after his dyuyne nature he is god and alwaye equall to the father, after his humayne nature he humbled him ſelfe and toke the ſhape of a ſeruaunte vpon him, and in ſhape and maner of lyuynge was a man and toke all the infirmites of man vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ſynne onely excepted (for he neuer ſinned nor in him was any crafte founde) and thus Chriſt dyd humble him ſelfe that by his hum<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>blenes he ſhulde exalte vs, and brynge vs to heauen, and by his example of humilite repro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue our arrogante hartes and ſtomakes, and teache hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blenes of harte &amp; mynde in wordes &amp; workes, &amp; not onely chriſt humbled him ſelfe i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſhape of a ſeruante or as a ſeruaunte, but alſo he humbled him ſelfe to death and that to the death of the croſſe, that by his death we ſhulde be delyuered from death, for by death he ouer came death and brought vs that was
<pb facs="tcp:183793:47"/>
ded by ſynne to eternall lyfe, vnto the whiche we ſhulde neuer haue comed if Chriſt had not ſuffered death for vs to brynge vs to lyfe.</p>
            <q>Therfore hath god exalted him and gyuen him a name, which is aboue all names, that in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of Ieſus euery kne ſhulde bowe, both of thynges vnder the earth, and that all tonges ſhulde confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſt is the lorde vnto the prayſe of god the father.</q>
            <p>Becauſe before he ſhewed the humylyte of Chriſt, and that vnto the death of the croſſe, that no man ſhulde thynke Chriſte alwaye to be in that humblenes of the croſſe, or thynke that Chriſte was ſo receyued of the father of heauen as he was of the worlde, nowe he ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth of the exaltacion or of the glory of chriſt that folowed his humblenes of the croſſe, that no man ſhulde thynke men to loſe any honour or glory by humilyte, but rather to get therby hye honours with men and great glorye with god. For the ſcrypture ſayth. Math. 19. That he that humbleth them ſelfe ſhall be exalted, and he that exalteth him ſelfe ſhall be humyliated and made lawe. And here of a rewarde that is of exaltyng he exhorteth men to humylyte after the example of Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:183793:48"/>
Ieſus, we may be aſhamed to be proude, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our lorde and mayſter is humble, and yf we wyll or deſyre to be exalted, let vs be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and lowly in our ſelfes, for the waye to hye honours be by humylite and by the croſſe, although fleſſhe and worldly wyſedome do not iudge ſo, but the contrarye.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſayth that god hath exalted Chriſte Ieſus to hye honours and gyuen him a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me aboue all names, whiche ſaynge are to be vnderſtanded not ſo, that Chriſt was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye in hyeſt honours, or that his name was not alwayes aboue all other names af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his deite and diuine nature, by the which he was lyke to the father &amp; one with him i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce deyte &amp; glory, but this is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after his humayne nature, and after it he was exalted to hye honours and to a name aboue al other names, and his name is taken in this place as oftymes in ſcripture for his powre and maieſtye, whiche Chriſt had aboue all other powres &amp; maieſty aboue all creatures of the worlde, that all creatures in the worlde in heauen and in earth ſhulde be obedient to him ſhulde bowe their knees to him and gyue him honour and reuerence and acknowledge him to be lorde ouer all creatures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And that all tonges ſhulde confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſte is the lorde vnto the prayſe of god the father.) God hath exalted Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus alſo that all tonges of angelles of men and of all other creatures ſhulde confeſſe Chriſte Ieſus to be lorde ouer all them, and that of him haue they helth lyfe and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb facs="tcp:183793:48"/>
and of none other but of him alone and by him and in him, and that vnto the glory of god, that all thynges ſhulde be done to god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des glorye, and that o to honour Chriſt is to the glorye of the father.</p>
            <q>Wherfore my deare beloued as ye haue alwaye obeyed (not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in my preſence, but now alſo moch more in my abſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce) euen ſo worke out your owne ſaluation with feare and tremlyng. For it is god whiche worketh both the wyll and the dede, euen of his owne good wyll.</q>
            <p>Of theſe wordes that go before he now as it were gathereth a conclutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after this wiſe. you ſe what is the loue of Chriſte towardes you, that dyd redeme you from ſynne death hell the deuyll, and all the thraldome of the deuyll, and that by no corruptyble thynge, but by his precious bloode. 1. Peter. 1. you alſo haue barde what was Chriſtes humilite vnto the death of the groſſe for our ſakes, to bryng lyfe vnto vs all by his death, and how he ſought alwayes the health and ſaluation of other, do you ſuche lyke as Chriſte dyd, be humble and meke, louyng and charitable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye ſeke the profyt of other, and contynew
<pb facs="tcp:183793:49"/>
in the ſame, and you ſhall be exalted with Chriſt vnto glory, not by your ſelfes, but by Chriſt. And here he exhorteth them after this maner, derebelouyd hetherto you haue bene obedient to my counſell whiche I dyd gyue you for your heithe both in my preſence and abſence, and you haue bene folowers of Chriſt, walkyng accordyng to your vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, now do that I deſyre of you for your profyt, and here he prayſeth them for their trew obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to him that by that meanes he myght make them nowe more obediente to his hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome counſelle and do them with more glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. So we learne that we ſhulde do good not onely in the preſence of the paſtor but alſo in his abſence, as the ſeruaunte is bonde not onely to do well in his maiſters preſence but alſo in his abſence. Ephe. 6. For in ſo doyng, they ſerue god which is preſent alwaye, and alwaye do ſe them, and loke vpon them, and they trewly and faythfully ſeruynge their maiſter do ſerue god. So let vs alwaye be obedient to god and to his worde, be humble and meke, ſekynge alwaye thynges profyta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to other, and we ſhall be ſure to be exalted with Chriſt to glory in heauen.</p>
            <p n="3">3. with feare and tremblynge worke your owne ſaluation.) Here is ſhewed what thing he wolde haue them to do now in his abſence, that they ſhulde do and worke not theſe thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that ſhulde tende to profyt or commodite to him but to their owne helth and ſaluation and that they ſhuld worke their owne ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with feare and tremblynge, as they do

whiche worketh with feare and drede they take good hede that nothynge be done amyſſe or otherwyſe then it ſhulde be done. And he byddeth them worke their owne ſaluation, not that he meaned they coulde do that thing without Chriſt or without the grace of god, for that they can not do, as it foloweth after wardes here, but he thought to haue concorde vnite of the ſpirite of god, humblenes of mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to ſeke the profyt of other that theſe be thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges perteynyng to ſaluation, and theſe that do theſe thynges he calleth to worke their owne ſaluation, for theſe workes they do that ſhallbe ſaued by Chriſte and theſe that ſhall not be ſaued, do not theſe workes, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary workes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For it is god that worketh in you both the wyll and the dede / euen of his owne good wyll.) Theſe wordes he addeth, leſte any man ſhulde attribute or aſcrybe his owne helth iuſtice or ſaluation, to his myghtes powers merites or workes done by him or them with out goddes grace or without Chriſte, therfore he ſayth that it is god that worketh in vs that we do wyll good thynges, and that we do good workes, and that of his owne good wyl and mynde, and not for our good wylles ſake, for we without goddes grace can not wyll any good thynge of our ſelfe, as of our ſelfe, but we helped with the grace of god do wyll and do good thynges by goddes grace, by the which our euyll wyll of it ſelfe is made comformable to goddes wyl, &amp; ſo wyllyngly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and gladly we do good thynges.

            <p n="3">3.

And here is a great argumente of loue of the paſtor when he deſyreth to take awaye all heuynes from his flocke, and agayne an argument of loue of the people to their paſtor or curate when they are ſory their paſtor to be ſycke or any aduerſite to chaunce to him, and that they can not be mery or glade tyll they here he be made hole, or delyuered from his trouble, as theſe Philippians was in great heuynes for the ſyckenes of Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus and was merye when they dyd ſe him recouered from his ſyckenes, and therfore Paule ſent rather Epaphroditus to them,

who taketh awaye ſicknes of the body and who delyuereth men from their bodyly ſycke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſuerly no other but god the creator and gouernour of all thynges, therfore god is to be called vpon in all aduerſites ſycknes and tribulations by Ieſus Chriſt our mediatour and aduocate to the father of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 1.

And here we learne that it is of the mercy of god that ſicknes be put away and that thoſe that be ſicke be made hole, &amp; not of any vertu or holynes, of ony hewen ſtone carued or paynted poſte or pyller, or of any image made carued or paynted. wherfore they haue erred from the treweth, and haue robbed god of his glory, that hath aſcrybed health of body to this or to that image made of ſtone or of woodde and not to god alone, and to him alone hath not geuen dewe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes as to the onely aucthor of their health onely of his mercy and grace. The apoſtle ſheweth another cauſe of the marcy of god to him in the recouery of helth to Epaphrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, that he ſhuld not haue ſorow vpon ſorow here you maye ſe Paule not to be clere from all afflictions of the fleſhe, as from all ioye and ſorowe, but to ſuche carnall affections ſubiected and to haue ſometymes bene trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with all, as other men be lyuyng in this worlde, wherfore they that thynkes the apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els

Beholde the lyfe of a goodman is very profytable to the lyuynge people, and therfore they reioyce of his corporal health and be ſory of his ſicknes, or of his death, but not as the hethen do, as there were no lyfe ioye ne blyſſe in a nother worlde after this preſent lyfe in the worlde to come, where as good men ſhalbe made immor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tall and in ſuch ioye blyſſe and glory as no tonge can tell, nor harte thynke that glory that god hath prepared for them that ſhall loue him in the ende of their lyues. 1.

And this place reproueth euil paſtors that be nother loued of their paryſh, bycauſe of necgligence of their office and alſo for their vnprofitablenes amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges their flocke.

            <p n="2">2. Receyue him in the lorde therfore with all gladnes.)

            <p n="4">4. To fulfyll the ſeruyce whiche was lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge on your parte towardes me.) Here is the cauſe ſhewed why Epaphroditus was ſo diligent to ſerue Paule and put him ſelfe in ſuche iopardy of ſyckenes, it was to fulfyll their offyce and deuty they ought to haue done to Paule, therfore he ſayth, that deuty you ought to haue done to me this Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus hath fulfylled it in your preſence to me
<pb facs="tcp:183793:60"/>

And let euery man be diligent in his office or vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he is called to of god, and not tender him ſelfe his fleſſhe to moch or make to moch of him ſelfe, for we ſhulde not ſtudy to lyue longe, but to lyue well, for to lyue longe it is not in vs, but in god, who knoweth the tyme and houre of death whiche be vnknowne to vs, nor yet the maner of our death nor the place where we ſhall dye, nothynge is more certayne then that we ſhall dye, but nothynge more vncertayne then the houre place and maner of death.

And firſt he moueth them to do and folowe trew thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, wherby he putteth away all deceyt craft
<pb facs="tcp:183793:80"/>
hypochryſy and ſimulation, as Chriſte is the treweth and loueth the treweth, ſo he hateth all craft and falſed, and it is a meruell that any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyll loue that thing, that god hateth ſo moch, as falſed craft deceyt and ſimulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is a toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they loue the deuyl a falſe lyer bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god which is alway trew and hateth lyes and falſed, it is a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der to ſe how ſome men wyll geue credence to the deuyll lyenge rather then to god ſaynge treweth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſynge neceſſares to all them that ſeke him in treweth, that ſeke firſt the kyngdome of god and his iuſtice, it is a token that ſuch be rather the ſeruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of the deuyl then of god. And thefore they myſtruſtynge god runnes hedlynges to the deuyll and vſe his craft and falſed with moche deceyte &amp; many lyes gettes their lyuyng to the great hurte of other, to their owne iudgement and damnation, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leue the craftes of the deuyll and folowe Chriſt and his treweth yf you wyll be ſaued and come to euerlaſtynge ſaluation.</p>
            <p>Secondly folowe honeſt thynges ſemynge and becommyng for chriſtians wordy prayſe, and mete for theſe that abhorreth vnhoneſty fylthy vayne folyſhe and tryflyng thynges, in the which ſayng the apoſtle wolde that our be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>hauyour of our body in habyte veſture worde dede lacke countenaunce goynge and all thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges about vs ſhulde be honeſt and comely for our ſtate and degre, and in this thynge he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth all them that kepe not ſemely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or facio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in habyte geſture wordes dedes as becommeth their degre or vocation. The
<pb facs="tcp:183793:81"/>
apoſtle wolde all thynges to be done ſemely &amp; after a comely order. And here he reproueth ſuche as their vocation requireth them to be ſober ſadde and diſcrete men and men of gra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uite and wyſedome, that be lyght in maners ful of wordes, that do not become their voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mockers and ſcorners of other, ieſters and raylers of all others maners, and ſuche as cauſe men to laugh, when it becommeth their ſtate &amp; vocacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be men of grauyte ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briete and to geue to other example of ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. And here he reproueth all vncleane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication fylthy or baudy wordes, vncle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly maners or ieſtynges, all ſcoffynge raylynge that do not become chriſtians, ſober wyſe and diſcret men. Thirdly he exhorteth them to do all iuſt thynges, for iuſtice is that thyng wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by is gyuen to euery one that is dew for him, wherby no man ſhulde deſyre but that is his and equall and iuſt to be gyuen to him, by the whiche ſaynge he condempneth all iniuries wronges rapynes thefte murder crafte falſed in byeng ſellyng in chaungynge one thyng for an other, and by iuſtice we be taught to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to god that perteyneth to god, and to geue to man that pertayne to man, and in this he reproueth thoſe that aſcribe to them ſelfes to their myghtes merites powers the grace of god, preſeruacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them from euyll, remyſſion of ſinnes and lyfe eternal, and that of the merites and wordynes of their workes Theſe thynges muſte be of iuſtice aſcrybed onely to Chriſt our ſauyour that is to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile vs to the father of heauen, to iuſtifye vs,
<pb facs="tcp:183793:81"/>
to take awaye our ſynnes and to gyue lyfe euerlaſtynge theſe be workes of god pertay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng to god, and to him onely to be aſcribed, &amp; to none other, nether men worde ne dede. Fortly he exhorteth men to pure and clene ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng, for it becommeth chriſtians to be pure and chaſt in hart mynde ſoule and body and to flee all adultry fornycation fylthy and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane communication, and not one fylthy worde to come ones out of their mouthes as the apoſtle ſayth. Ephe. 4. Let no fylthy word go ones out of your mouth, yea he byddeth theſe Epheſians. Ephe. 5. That no vncleane communication be harde amongeſt them, for the vengeaunce of god commeth vpon ſuche. Fyftly he willeth them to do all thynges that pertayne to loue, to do good to all men both to frendes and foes, and to pleaſe all men in all goodnes &amp; humblenes, to hurte no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but profyte euery man, to offende no man, and ſo do good alwaye, and in al places, after their habilite. Syxtly he wylleth them to do theſe thynges that may get them a good fame and name, and to do theſe thynges that be wordy laude and prayſe before god and man, that is to do the wyll of god and to pleace god and to kepe goddes commaundementes, and in all good workes to walke, and that not for to get them a fame or name, but that the name of god myght in all thynges be magnifyed and gloryfyed alwaye of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the world. 2. If there be any vertuous thyng, yf there be any laudable thynge.) He moueth them to folow all vertuous thynges, and all thynges
<pb facs="tcp:183793:82"/>
that be wordy laude or prayſe before god or ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not in theſe thynges ſeke their owne prayſe or commendations, but the prayſe of god, that god myght be gloryfyed, and his name ſanctifyed by the vertuous lyuynge of good men amongeſt the hethen nacion, a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mongeſt whom goddes holy name here moch euyll, and is euyll ſpoken on for the wycked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſynnes of euyl chriſtians, that lyueth not accordyng to their profeſſion at the fonte ſtone. He wold they ſhulde haue in mynde all vertuous and laudable thynges whiche they had learned of him, harde and ſene in him practiſed, wolde to god that all byſhoppes paſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tors prelates, Kynges Prynces Emperours Dukes Earles Lordes Laweers wolde lyue ſo vertuouſly ſo holyly ſo godly, that their lyues myght be a myrrour or glaſſe to loke in, and to ſpye in them all vertu all humblenes and mekenes, loue of god and of his worde vnfaynedly, and that they ſought the glorye of god the helth of their people more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their owne glory pleaſure or commodite, then the name of god ſhulde be more gloryfied then it is, then the name of god ſhulde not here euyll amongeſt the hethen, amongeſt whome the name of god is blaſphemed bycauſe many chriſtianes lyue worſe then doth the hethen people.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The god of peace ſhalbe with you.) Now he promyſeth to them god of peace to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them, yf they wyll folowe Chriſte, here his doctryne and lerne it, lyue after it and go forwardes in all vertu and godlynes, as
<pb facs="tcp:183793:82"/>
he teached them ſhewyng a rewarde alwaye to folow vertuous lyuing as the god of peace to be with them to pacifye and quiet their conſcience, that they ſhulde be at peace with god, and ſo of a rewarde he exhorteth them to vertu.</p>
            <q>I reioyce greatly in the lorde, that now at the laſt ye are reuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued agayne to care for me, as ye cared for me afore, but ye lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked opportunyte.

            <p>The apoſtle gyueth thankes to theſe Philippians for their dewtyes and offices
<pb facs="tcp:183793:83"/>
done to him, and for their charite ſend to him in priſon by Epaphroditus, here we lerne to gyue thankes to our benefactours for their benefittes done to vs, leſt we ſhulde be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnthankefull or without good ciuilite or ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyl maners, although theſe that do kynd<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes were bounde of dewty to do that thynge they dyd, as theſe Philippians was bounde to do no leſſe to Paule then they dyd, ye here Paule reioyſes in the lorde that their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to helpe him was in them reuiued againe and quyckened, and they dyd retourne to do their deutye they had omytted for a tyme towardes him, wherin he teacheth vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce of the amendement of them that hath for a tyme neglected or omytted to do their dewty to any man dew, or to paye their det<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, or to geue to their paſtors that is dewe to them for neceſſares to be payd or gyuen.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the which you were carefull, but you lacked opportunite.) Here he partly excuſe them of their negligence that they ceaſed of for a tyme to ſend him neceſſares in priſon, as he wolde ſay he ſpeketh, I know you were carefull for me, and that you wolde haue ſend to me ſuche thynges as you thought I ſhulde nede, I thynke you dyd not forget me, I do not reproue you for your dewty vndone to me, I knowe you lacked no good mynde or wyll, but you had no opportunite, nor man conuenient meſſanger faythfull and truſtye by whome you ſhulde haue ſent your charyte with all, whiche you ſent to me by Epaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus. And here priuely he reproueth
<pb facs="tcp:183793:83"/>
them of their faute, &amp; ſlouthfulnes teachynge them what they ought to haue done to him, but he preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tyng their excuſe ſayth that they wanted opportunyte to ſend to him ſuch thyn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges as he neded, and ſo opportunite ſtandeth in the ſtede oftymes of an excuſe or elles by opportunite he vnderſtandeth their afflycti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and tribulacions by the which they were letted for a tyme to ſende to him neceſſaries, and ſo opportunite then was a iuſt excuſe for them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I ſpake not this bycauſe of neceſſite.) I ſaye not theſe wordes bycauſe of your faute or negligence I lacked neceſſares or was in great nede, or culde not lyue without your helpe, for I haue learned to take all chaunces of lyuynge as they chaunce to me by expery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to be contented with my lotte as it ſhall chaunce. If I haue plenty of ryches, I geue lyberally to the helpyng of the poore and nedy, yf I haue no plenty, I drawe backe my hande, and faſſhyon me after myne habilyte, and geue as I may and not as I wolde, ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes do not corrupte me yf I haue plenty and more then for my neceſſites, nor hunger do not deiecte me or put me out of comforte, yf I lacke ſomtymes theſe thynges I wolde haue, or be neceſſary for me. Here the apoſtle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the trew vſe of ryches and of pouerty, the trew vſe of both is to be contended with his lotte, it pertayneth to the rych man not to be prowde for his ryches, or to thynke him ſelfe therby better then other be, or to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne other, or to thynke he had his riches of him

Alſo here we maye lerne it is not euyll to haue great ryches, but it is euyll to abuſe greate ryches as to be prowd for ryches gyuen, to extolle them ſelfes aboue other to contempne or oppreſſe other, to truſt in ryches to make ryches their god, to ſhyt vp their handes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> helpyng of the nedy, ſo ryches are not to be deſpyſed, but the abuſe of ryche is to be diſpyſed, for many holy ſain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes as Abraham Iſaac Iacob Loth Iob Da<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uyd had great ryches, but they dyd not abuſe their ryches but vſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wel, beſtowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the glory of god, and was liberall to ſuch as had nede, and keped hoſpitalite and receyued nedy into their houſes and myniſtered to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neceſſares more gladly, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the geſtes oftimes deſired, and therfore they brought geſtes home to their houſes as it were by inforcement or agaynſt their wyll, ſo ready they were to do the marcyfull worke of hoſpytalyte and they lacked not their rewarde of god.
